SECTIONS:

Home
The "Home" section functions as the captivating landing page of my website. 
Its purpose is to warmly welcome visitors and prominently showcase my areas of expertise. A strategically placed 
button invites visitors to explore an overview of my skills and accomplishments. Additionally, a visually stunning 
design element or background image is incorporated to create an engaging and memorable first impression. Finally, a
footer is included, providing links to my social media accounts for further connection and interaction.

About me
The "About Me" section offers a concise yet informative introduction to my identity as a full-stack digital marketer,
 highlighting my specific area of specialization. Within this section, you will discover a well-crafted bio that 
 captures the essence of who I am professionally. Furthermore, I showcase my relevant skills, emphasizing my 
 expertise in the field.

To encourage engagement, there are two strategically placed buttons. The first button, labeled "Hire Me," 
serves as a clear call-to-action, redirecting visitors to my dedicated contact page where they can initiate further
discussion. The second button, labeled "Download CV," provides a direct link to a PDF document of my curriculum 
vitae, enabling interested individuals to easily access and review my credentials.
	
Portfolio
The "Portfolio" section serves as a showcase for a curated selection of my finest frontend projects, including 
social media management and web design projects. Additionally, this section highlights my valuable work experience, 
educational background, and certifications.

Each project is thoughtfully presented with a brief description, and a direct link is provided to view the project 
live. This allows visitors to explore the functionality and design of each project in real-time, providing them 
with a comprehensive understanding of my skills and capabilities.
